What is the one thing in life you can be guaranteed of? **Change**. If you arenâ€™t changing it means you are dead, so be happy about that.

When things change, that causes **problems**.

As a smart person when you are faced with a problem you find a **solution**!

What do solutions cause? Oops.

As you can see, *you will always have problems*...

The real question to ask is: Do you have the *right* problems?

For a new startup, battling with cashflow is the _right_ kind of problem to have. A company that has been around for 10 years and having cashflow issues is experiencing the _wrong_ problem.

Celebrate and embrace your right problems. Resist the urge sweep them under the rug or they will become wrong problems. When you find a genuine wrong problem, step back. Think about how the systems allowed that problem to happen and how the system could be changed to prevent it in future.
