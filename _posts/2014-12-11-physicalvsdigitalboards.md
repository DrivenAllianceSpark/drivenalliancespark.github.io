It depends what you need the board for. If your need is for automated measuring and reporting then a digital board makes it less work to do that. If your need is for a lightweight representation of what your process looks like today, and where all the work is right now, then you'll should lean towards stickies on a whiteboard in your own work area. 

The transaction cost of tweaking a digital tool is just high enough that people won't do it - they will assume whoever set up the tool knew what is best. Now the team doesn't own their process anymore, they are letting a tool dictate it.

Physical boards have no obvious path of least resistance to follow. Nobody else to look at when it's not working. Physical boards can be tweaked constantly in real time by the people doing the work, with little to no transaction cost.

Always start with Needs. Never start with Tools.
